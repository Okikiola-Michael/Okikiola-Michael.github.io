Education
=========
* Ph.D. Environmental and Natural Resources, Washington State University, (2023 - 2026).
* M.S. in Forestry (Forest Biometrics and Remote Sensing), Mississippi State University, (2021 - 2023).
* B. Forestry, University of Ibadan, (2015 - 2020).

Work experience
=========
* Research/Teaching Assistant, Department of Forestry, Mississippi State University. 2022-2023
  * I am working on the research topic “Small Area Estimation of County Based Forest Attributes using Forest Inventory Data
      and Remotely Sensed as Auxiliary Information”. The research focuses on modeling forest attributes (Above Ground
      Biomass; Total Volume; Merchantable Volume; Lorey’s Height and Basal Area) using Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data with remotely sensed data.
  * Advanced data analysis using the R programming language
  * I anchored a lab session that trained students on the use of the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS) for growth and yield modeling.
  
* Research Assistant/Lab Manager, Forest Biometrics/GIS Lab, University of Ibadan. 2021
  * I worked as the team leader for spatial and forest Inventory data collection.
  * I served as a remote sensing data analyst. I worked as a UAV pilot and flew DJI Phantom 4 Pro II and analyzed both aerial and satellite images.
  * I was involved in grading and recording assessments and in taking tutorials for the students.
  
* Research Intern, University of Ibadan 2019
  * I served as an intern in the Geographic Information Systems laboratory. Some of the analyses carried out include, Land use/land cover classification using remote sensing, an ecological survey of forest tree species, and statistical analyses of forest inventory data.

* Research Intern, Forestry Institute of Nigeria (FRIN) 2018
  * Forest Inventory and Enumeration
  * Land use/land cover classification using remote sensing
  * An ecological survey of forest tree species
