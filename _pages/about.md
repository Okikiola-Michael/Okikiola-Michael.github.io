!!!  Webpage Under Construction!!!

I am currently a master's student of foresty with an emphasis on forest biometrics and remote sensing at the [Mississippi State University](https://www.forestry.msstate.edu/people/oma45). I also work as a graduate research and teaching assistant with [Dr. Krishna Poudel](https://www.fwrc.msstate.edu/people/kpp70) in his lab. My thesis focuses on modeling forest attributes using forest inventory (FIA) data with remotely sensed data using the small area estimation technique. The idea is to improve the precision level of forest estimates using different sources of auxiiary information.

I am a passionate researcher. I set short and long-term goals and when I achieve them, I feel fulfilled. Discovering processes, effective communication of results, acquiring useful and relevant knowledge, and finding solutions to problems are my core values. I find learning a continuous process, hence, I am an ardent learner as I believe that "A mind that knows, is a mind that's free". 

I am a good team player that's realistic and objective and that loves meaningful collaboration.
